<h1>Release Notes</h1>

<h2>MBTA Data Feed</h2>
Static data, GTFS routes, stops, schedules, etc, can be picked up here:

Dynamic data, vehicle location data, can be picked up here:

<h2>Implementation Details:</h2>
Prior to knowing about the GTFS data availability, I pulled static data from the realtime feed.  While it contained GIS stop locations 
it did not contain schedule information.  Schedules could be pulled from it, but only three hours ahead of current time.  Fortunately, I 
found the other site containing published schedules and stop locations.

The GTFS data is not well-structured for everything I want to do.  For example, to display a route on Google Maps, one wants the GIS center 
point of the route and zoom-level to frame the route in the available space.  The first step is calculating the bounding box of the route 
which turns out to be computationally expensive because three tables must be joined, "trips", "stop_times", and "stops".  Because the join 
includes "trips", the number of resulting rows is huge.  Then, of course, the min() and max() routines have more to sort.  Bottom line, the 
map was taking 10 seconds to display, 99% of which is DB work.  To cut the time down, I pre-compute a table called route_bounds.  It will 
probably be important to recompute this table when the GTFS update comes out in case bus routes change.

After pre-computing the route_bounds table, I see missing data for Commuter Rails, Ferries and Shuttle Buses - I guess I will have to 
collect that data from the live feed.  (sigh)

Another issue is consistency.  There are 5 transportation modes, "Trolley", "Subway", "Commuter Rail", "Bus", "Ferry".  The Green line is 
classified as a "Trolley", however, the description field then calls it "Rapid Transit" - why not stick with "Trolley"?!?!?  In another 
example, the Silver Line bus routes are also called "Rapid Transit" when most Bus routes are simply called "Local Bus" or "Shuttle". 
Several bus routes are described as "Key Bus Route (Frequent Service)" - what does that mean and how does it fit between "Local Bus" and 
"Shuttle"?
