<h3>Find a route and add it to the list of routes that are tracked for scoring.</h3>

<div class="clearfix">
	<p style="font-style: italic;">
		To find a transportation route of interest, begin by selecting the MODE of transportation (Subway, Bus, etc).  The system will automatically
		default	to the first ROUTE in the list.  You may then select a ROUTE and the system will automatically default to the first TRIP in the list.
		A TRIP is one direction of the ROUTE, sometimes it is a variation of a ROUTE.  "0" is typically "out-bound" and "1" is typically "in-bound".
		The system will automatically default to the first type of SERVICE on the ROUTE.  A SERVICE differentiates "Weekday" from "Saturday" and "Sunday".
		A SERVICE also differentiates "Holidays" from "non-Holidays".  
		
		Clicking the "Add Route to Collection" button will add all the TRIPS & SERVICES of a given ROUTE to the short list of ROUTES begin tracked
		by the system.  You must have Administrator privileges to add a route for tracking.
