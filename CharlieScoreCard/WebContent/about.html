      <h3>Charlie Analytics</h3>
      
      The goal of this project was to support  (or refute) the assertion that the MBTA buses serving Watertown are inadequate.
      Specifically, the claims include, long waits, inaccurate schedules, insufficient equipment and crowded buses.</br></br>
      This project collects realtime and static dimensional data from the MBTA developer site into a database which then feeds into a series of reports.</br>
      <a href="http://realtime.mbta.com/portal">MBTA Developer's Portal</a>
      
      <h4>Analytic Views of Project</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>The available data includes Routes, Trips, Schedules and Stops. This data is static and doesn't generally change.</li>
      <li>The available data also include realtime data consisting of updates from the buses every 30-40 seconds.  These updates include which Route the vehicle is on,
      which Scheduled Trip it is making and the longitude/latitude coordinates at a specific date and time.</li>
      <li>Associating the realtime data with the schedule data and, in some cases, layering on Google Maps, we can read and visually interpret how the bus
      is performing against expectation for a single trip or a collection of trips such as daily or weekly averages.</li>
      <li>We can judge performance to be reasonable from a rider perspective.</li>
      <li>We can use performance to comment on whether schedules are achievable given a fixed number of vehicles and average/weather traffic conditions.</li>
      <li>We can build a case for equipment and/or schedule and/or policy changes.  (An example policy change might be to keep buses a uniform distance and
      and time apart from one another so that there are never large gaps and times between them.)</li>
      </ul>
